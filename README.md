> Deploy artefacts with aws-cli to S3

Deploys a `local` directory to a `dest` directory of an S3 bucket. Sets a `cache-control` header to a far-future expiry (one year) for everything *except* `index.html`, which is set to `no-cache, no-store`. Archives existing `dest` under a datetime directory scheme. Intended to be used as a [TravisCI deploy script][travis-dpl].

## Installation

```shell
# pip install awscli
npm install --save awss3-deploy
```

[awscli]: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

## Usage

```shell
BUCKET="mybucket" LOCAL_DIR="dist" UPLOAD_DIR="dev" ./node_modules/.bin/awss3-deploy
```

### TravisCI

`.travis.yml`:

```yml
before_deploy:
  - export BUCKET=mybucket LOCAL_DIR=dist UPLOAD_DIR=dev
deploy:
  provider: script
  script: awss3-deploy
  skip_cleanup: true
```

## ITYMFAQLT

> I think you might frequently ask questions like these

### Why not Travis' default S3 deployment provider?

* It does not support per-object cache-control headers (*yet*; see: [#170][])
* We needed additional life-cycle/archival rules (alternatively, AWS Lambda could be used)
